## Features

- Flexible market simulation framework
- Various trader types (e.g., informed traders, noise traders, market makers)
- Customizable trading strategies
- Comprehensive set of market performance metrics
- Order book visualization tools
- Easy-to-use API for creating and running simulations

### Key Components

- **Markets**: Implement different market models (e.g., continuous double auction)
- **Traders**: Model various types of market participants
- **Orders**: Support for different order types (e.g., market orders, limit orders)
- **Strategies**: Implement and test different trading strategies
- **Metrics**: Analyze market efficiency, liquidity, and other performance indicators

## Installation

To install pymicrostructure, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pymicrostructure
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with pymicrostructure:

```python
from pymicrostructure.markets.continuous import ContinuousDoubleAuction
from pymicrostructure.traders.market_maker import *
from pymicrostructure.traders.informed import *
from pymicrostructure.traders.noise import *
from pymicrostructure.traders.strategy import *

from pymicrostructure.visualization.summary import participant_comparison, price_path
from pymicrostructure.metrics.trader import participants_report

market   = ContinuousDoubleAuction(initial_fair_price=1000)
mm       = BaseMarketMaker(market,
                           fair_price_strategy=OrderFlowMagnitudeFairPrice(window=10, aggressiveness=1),
                           volume_strategy=MaxFractionVolume(fraction=0.1), 
                           spread_strategy=OrderFlowImbalanceSpread(window=5, aggressiveness=10, min_halfspread=3),
                           max_inventory=1000)

informed = TWAPInformedTrader(market)
noise    = NoiseTrader(market, submission_rate=1, volume_size=lambda:np.random.randint(1, 5))

market.run(300)
participant_comparison(market.participants)
price_path(market)
```
